# Implementation Plan

## UI Checkpoint Strategy

This implementation plan now includes **UI Checkpoint tasks (19-24)** that focus on incremental, deployable milestones. Each checkpoint ensures:

- **Isolated functionality** - Each UI component works independently
- **Vercel deployment success** - Every checkpoint must deploy without errors
- **Progressive enhancement** - Features build on previous working checkpoints
- **Mobile-first design** - All interfaces tested on mobile devices
- **Graceful degradation** - Advanced features fail gracefully when unavailable

### Checkpoint Phases:
- **19-19.1**: Basic navigation and authentication (static pages first)
- **20-20.1**: Core data management (forms before database integration)
- **21-21.1**: Inventory tracking (manual entry before voice features)
- **22-22.1**: File processing (upload before complex processing)
- **23**: Export system (complete feature with testing)
- **24**: Dashboard and analytics (final user-facing features)

Each checkpoint must be **deployed and verified working** before proceeding to the next.
